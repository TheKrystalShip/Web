      <description>TheKrystalShip.Discord is an API wrapper library written in C# targetting .Net Standard 2.0 for Discord, with the purpose of making Discord bots.
There are a couple of libraries out there already, like RogueException&amp;rsquo;s Discord.Net library, or DSharpPlus which are both great libraries (personally used Discord.Net in more than a couple of projects, one of which is Inquisition), and the main inspiration for the creation of this one.
The purpose when starting working on this library was to make a complete package for bot creators, have all the most used bot features ready out of the box without the creators having to do boilerplate code just for some audio playback for example, since this library would come with all the audio search, download &amp;amp; playback required to get up and running just by plugging in a few simple commands.</description>
